# Ascii Art

Write a function printL in a class [AsciiArt](Java/src/codility/motorola/AsciiArt.java) that prints out ASCII-art in the shape of the capital letter L. Parameter N is an integer (between 1 and 120) and represents the expected size of the ASCII-art.

For example, here is the output for N = 4;
```

The function shouldn't return any value.
