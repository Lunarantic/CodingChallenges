# Ascii Art

Write a function printL that prints out ASCII-art in the shape of the capital letter L, made up of copies of capital letter L. Parameter N is an integer (between 1 and 100) and represents the expected size of the ASCII-art (the output should comprise N rows, the last of which should comprise N letters L).

For example, here is the output for N = 4;
```
L

LLLL
```
The function shouldn't return any value.
